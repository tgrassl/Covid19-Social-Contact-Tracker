## ðŸ“± Demo
Android:
[Android APK](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yHNAtayV3Q0zx_YLJMP8LQunQYg8Rd7J)
or from [Github Releases](https://github.com/tgrassl/Covid19-Social-Contact-Tracker/releases/tag/1.0.1)

Demo for iOS follows.

## ðŸŽ¯ Target
Now my Covid-19 test is positive... but who exactly have I been seeing the last 14 days? 
The Social Contact Tracker allows you to track activities and notify direct contacts when illness occurs. 

## ðŸ’­ Background
How can an affected person (tested positive or suspected) inform the contacts of the last 14 days? Example: I took a bus from A to B last week. I don't even know at what time. Or: When did I meet with X or Y last Tuesday?

**The app was designed and developed by me within 48h for the [WirVsVirusHackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/).**

The submission for it is on [DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/social-contact-tracking-corona-tagebuch).

## âš™ Functionality 
The user can track his activities and directly met contacts in the app and thus has a kind of diary for social interactions. If an illness is detected, some disease-related data can be entered and if desired, all active contacts can be notified by SMS with an automatically generated message.
Furthermore, the user has the possibility to get a daily notification so that he does not forget to record his activities.

### Example of a hint SMS
```
Hint:
I have had symptoms of Covid-19 since March 14, 2020.
I have already been to the doctor.
Please pay attention if you notice any symptoms 
and try not to infect anyone through carelessness.
